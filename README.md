This project is a simple implementation of **Mendeleevâ€™s Periodic Table** using only HTML.  
It displays all 118 chemical elements along with their **atomic number, symbol, and full name** in a pastel-themed layout.  
The table is created using the `<table>` tag, `border`, `cellpadding`, `bgcolor`, and other basic HTML attributes.
